  		<h1>Where are NYC’s Older Adult Centers?</h1>
  		<h2><i>With the projected growth of NYC's older adult population, residents in some boroughs may find themselves left behind by city services.</i></h2>

	<p style="margin-top: 20px;">
		New York has 317 city-run Older Adult Centers (OACs) that offer free meals, activities and social services to city residents over 60 years old. The city’s older adult population is growing at a rate nearly 17 times faster than its total population, making these centers a critical resource at the local level. However, OACs are unequally distributed across the five boroughs, posing social and health risks to those who have limited mobility or financial means. </p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
		As of 2023, Manhattan was the borough with the largest proportion of older adult residents, closely followed by Queens and Staten Island. Staten Island trails behind the rest of the city with only 1.3 OACs per 10,000 residents. However, the borough has a mostly suburban layout, and a larger proportion of its residents have cars that allow them to reach OACs beyond their neighborhood. </p>

	<p style="margin-top: 20px;">
		With only 1.7 OACs per 10,000 older adults, Queens also falls behind its counterparts. This poses greater concern given the older adult population is growing faster in Queens than any other borough, according to a January report from the Office of the New York State Comptroller. Queens is a hub for diverse immigrant populations, and 63 percent of older adults in Queens are immigrants, also the highest share of any borough.</p>
	<p>
		The service gaps in Queens underscore the importance of OACs to elders across the city. Experts have long emphasized older adult centers as a lifeline for older adults — among them Paula Span, who writes the New Old Age column for the New York Times. Span highlighted the importance of OACs in combatting the loneliness and isolation that many older adults face, especially those who live alone. </p>
	<p>
		The growing older adult population in New York, she noted, could render the city’s OACs under-resourced and inaccessible. </p>
	<p>
		“The proportion [of older adults] is rising,” said Span. “If there are the same number of older adult centers as there were 20 years ago, that might not be keeping up with the need.” </p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
		Span is right — New York City’s older adult population grew by 33.5% in the last decade, now totaling over 1.3 million. The number of OACs increased 27.3% during this time, failing to meet a rising demand.  </p>

	<p style="margin-top: 20px;">
		Forty neighborhoods across the city currently have no OACs. Other private, nonprofit and religious organizations also have adult daycare programs, but these can often pose logistical or financial burdens for older adults as opposed to the free and open-door policy of OACs. </p>
	<p>
		Nearly one in five older adults across New York City lives in poverty, and many more struggle with financial insecurity or lack retirement savings. These issues most recently came to light in early November, when mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani shared his intentions to replace Elizabeth Street Garden in Nolita with affordable housing for older adults. Mamdani also said last month that "Now is the time to deliver an affordability agenda for seniors who are being pushed out of the city they call home." The details of this agenda — and whether it includes more OACs — remain unclear as he prepares to take office in January. </p>
	<p>
		Politics aside, OAC attendance levels have yet to fully recover since the COVID-19 pandemic, meaning that outreach will remain a key factor in encouraging older adults to return. </p>
	<p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
		“There is a stigma around going to a senior center. Nobody wants to be old,” said Span. “Some people who could benefit from these programs — it’s hard to actually get them to show up.” </p>
